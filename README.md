# Use Your Brain
This project is a simplisitic java-based single player game. The objective is to navigate through a dim lit maze using logical deduction and memorization.

## Current Status
The project is currently in the prototype phase. The game will launch as an application and has a start screen, playing screen, and end screen. It takes WASD or the arrow keys as input, displaying your current position as a human figure. We use VS Code for development and testing. Be sure to use VS Code's "run java" rather than "run code" on 'Game.java'.
