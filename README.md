# Use Your Brain
This project is a simplisitic java-based single player game. The objective is to navigate through a dim lit maze using logical deduction and memorization.

## Current Status
The project is currently in the prototype phase. The game currently runs in command line but displays an application window. It takes WASD as input, displaying your current position in command line output. We use VS Code for development and testing. Be sure to use VS Code's "run java" rather than "run code" on 'Game.java'.
